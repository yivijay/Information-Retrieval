# Information-Retrieval
A classroom project that requires us to emulate term at at time AND and OR and Document at a time AND and OR

It assumes that we already have an existing dictionary of the form t/cxx/mdd/f,dd/f,....
where t is the term....
/c is a delimiter xx is the size of the terms postings' list....
/m is another delimiter and each dd/f is a list of documents that the term exists in along with its frequency
